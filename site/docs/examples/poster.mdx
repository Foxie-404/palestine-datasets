## Artist statement

History did not begin on October 7, 2023.

This poster is intended to reach out to people whose response to any mention of Gaza is “why don’t you condemn Hamas?”

I do.

I also condemn the mass killing of children.

I condemn genocide.<br/>
I condemn ethnic cleansing.<br/>
I condemn forced displacement.<br/>
I condemn annexation by force.<br/>
I condemn collective punishment.<br/>
I condemn the blockade of Gaza.<br/>
I condemn the killing of journalists.<br/>
I condemn attacks on medical workers.<br/>
I condemn impunity for war crimes.<br/>
I condemn indiscriminate bombardment.<br/>
I condemn the targeting of hospitals and schools.<br/>
I condemn starvation as a weapon of war.<br/>
I condemn apartheid and legal double standards.<br/>
I condemn the expansion of illegal settlements.<br/>
I condemn settler violence.<br/>
I condemn harassment by settlers.<br/>
I condemn administrative detention without trial.<br/>
I condemn the theft of water and land.<br/>
I condemn the poisoning of land, air, and water.<br/>
I condemn the lifelong trauma forced on a generation of children.<br/>
I condemn the stealing of education from Palestinian youth.<br/>
I condemn the dehumanisation of a people.<br/>
I condemn media laundering of propaganda.<br/>
I condemn the denial of self-determination.<br/>
I condemn religious provocation at holy sites.<br/>
I condemn western funding of weapons used on civilians.<br/>
I condemn lies that justify war crimes.<br/>
I condemn the silencing of dissent.

But a conversation needs to start somewhere. We need to reach people where they are, not where we want them to be. We can all agree that killing children is wrong, can’t we?
