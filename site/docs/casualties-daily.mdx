## Update Interval

We update this dataset everyday, but some values are updated less frequently (typically at least once a week):

- `killed_children_cum`
- `killed_women_cum`
- `civdef_killed_cum`
- `med_killed_cum`
- `press_killed_cum`

If there's no updated value for the given report date, the last reported value is used (since all of these fields are cumulative). This necessarily also applies to their corresponding `ext_`-prefixed fields.

## Daily Sources

There are four source values for daily casualty reports we use to build the time series:

- `mohtel` - [Gaza's Ministry of Health Telegram channel](https://t.me/s/MOHMediaGaza)
- `gmotel` - [Gaza's Government Media Office Telegram channel](https://t.me/s/mediagovps)
- `missing` - No official report was available for the given date (some reasons below)

The primary source is the Ministry of Health. The numbers they report only include those they can connect directly to an act of war. For example:

> [The] Ministry of Health has a policy of recording only direct casualties of war, such as those caused by missile strikes or war-related injuries. There are other deaths indirectly caused by the war, but we do not add them to the list of martyrs. For example, children who die due to malnutrition, lack of care, or because their mothers gave birth under difficult conditions and carried them in poor health, resulting in the birth of an underdeveloped infant who dies after a few days or lacked proper feeding, these cases are documented but not recorded as martyrs.

For more detail on how the ministry gathers their numbers, [read this Dropsite interview with Dr. Zaher al-Wahaidi](https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/how-gaza-health-ministry-counts-dead) from which the above excerpt is taken.

It's important to underscore that these sources do not account for the knock-on affects of these attacks. You can [read more about all the other considerations](/updates/gaza-ministry-casualty-context/) that go into estimating the true toll in Gaza.

Our methodology is to prioritize official sources for this dataset in order to best align the reporting time periods (`mohtel` falling back to `gmotel`). When communications were cut to Gaza, `gmotel` would provide reporting but in some cases neither would. Reports were also stopped during the humanitarian pause.

## Extrapolated (`ext_` fields)

Since official numbers weren't always available, and it can be useful to have a timeseries where all dates have values, we're providing the same official fields in extrapolated form using the following methodology:

- if the missing field was a cumulative one and we had an official report for a daily killed or injury count, we calculate the cumulative using the daily increment
- if the missing field was a daily increment and we had cumulative counts, we subtracted the reported cumulative count from the prior period for the missing daily count
- if we were missing both sets of numbers for a given reporting period we average the difference between surrounding periods
