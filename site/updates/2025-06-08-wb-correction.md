We have corrected an issue with our [West Bank Daily dataset](https://data.techforpalestine.org/docs/casualties-daily-west-bank/) involving the cumulative count of settler attacks that we build using [OCHA's weekly updates](https://www.ochaopt.org/crisis). The correction relates to our reporting of this number, not the underlying data we collect from OCHA.

On December 16, 2024, we incorporated OCHA's count of settler attacks in our total number, bringing the cumulative count of settler attacks since October 7, 2023 to 1,768. On the following day, December 17th, we kept the cumulative count set to the prior value of 1,736. This continued until recently which has led to an undercount of 32 settler attacks. We've fixed this continuity issue by updating all report values from and including December 17th, 2024 to build on each other. Each report date since then will have been increased by 32.

We've updated our process to ensure this doesn't occur again.
