We [previously noted in February](/updates/gaza-daily-truce-fields/) that we started including the breakdowns the Gaza Ministry of Health started reporting for the total killed for a given report date. These fields were added to [our documentation for the Gaza Daily Casualities dataset](/docs/casualties-daily/) but weren't surfaced properly in our JSON or CSV dataset formats. This has been fixed and you should see these optional fields present in reports going back to January of this year.
